### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Dynamic allocation issue in Spark executors.
---

Dynamic allocation in Spark executors refers to the feature that allows the cluster to allocate and deallocate resources at runtime based on the workload. This feature is designed to optimize the cluster's resource utilization by dynamically adjusting the number of executors based on the workload. However, if the dynamic allocation is not working as expected, it can cause performance issues and hinder the overall efficiency of the cluster. Troubleshooting and optimizing dynamic allocation is necessary to ensure that the cluster is functioning optimally.

### Parameters
```shell
export SPARK_CONFIG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_LOGS="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_SPARK_HOME="PLACEHOLDER"

export NEW_NUMBER_OF_NODES="PLACEHOLDER"

export MINIMUM_MEMORY_THRESHOLD="PLACEHOLDER"

export MINIMUM_CPU_THRESHOLD="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if Dynamic Allocation is enabled
```shell
grep spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if Executor Memory is set
```shell
grep spark.executor.memory ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if Driver Memory is set
```shell
grep spark.driver.memory ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if spark.shuffle.service.enabled is set to true
```shell
grep spark.shuffle.service.enabled ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if the number of executor cores is set
```shell
grep spark.executor.cores ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if the number of Executors is set
```shell
grep spark.executor.instances ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if the Spark Event log is enabled
```shell
grep spark.eventLog.enabled ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if the Spark Event log directory is set
```shell
grep spark.eventLog.dir ${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if there are any errors in Spark logs related to Dynamic Allocation
```shell
grep "DynamicAllocation.*error" ${SPARK_LOGS}
```

### Insufficient resources such as memory and CPU on the Spark cluster causing the dynamic allocation to fail.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# This script will diagnose insufficient resources such as memory and CPU on the Spark cluster causing the dynamic allocation to fail.



# Check if there is enough memory available on the cluster

free_mem=$(free -m | awk 'NR==2{print $7}')

if [ $free_mem -lt ${MINIMUM_MEMORY_THRESHOLD} ]; then

    echo "Insufficient memory available on the cluster"

fi



# Check if there is enough CPU available on the cluster

cpu_usage=$(top -bn1 | grep load | awk '{printf "%.2f\n", $(NF-2)}')

cpu_cores=$(nproc)

cpu_available=$(echo "$cpu_cores-$cpu_usage" | bc)

if [ $cpu_available -lt ${MINIMUM_CPU_THRESHOLD} ]; then

    echo "Insufficient CPU available on the cluster"

fi


```

## Repair

### Consider increasing the number of nodes in the Spark cluster to provide more resources for dynamic allocation.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Define variables

SPARK_HOME=${PATH_TO_SPARK_HOME}

CLUSTER_CONFIG=${SPARK_CONFIG_FILE}

NEW_NUM_NODES=${NEW_NUMBER_OF_NODES}



# Stop the Spark cluster

${SPARK_HOME}/sbin/stop-all.sh



# Edit the cluster configuration to increase the number of nodes

sed -i "s/num_nodes=.*/num_nodes=${NEW_NUM_NODES}/g" ${CLUSTER_CONFIG}



# Start the Spark cluster

${SPARK_HOME}/sbin/start-all.sh


```
